1. Hogwarts Four
https://relam24.github.io/Game/ 
Hogwarts Four is a take on the classic game of Connect Four but with the user's being immersed with Hogwarts culture. At Hogwarts, each house fights for house points-- at the end of the year those points are counted up and the winning house obtains a great honor: The House Cup. This makes the user feel as though they are fighting to get points for their house, and not just playing Connect Four. Design: I designed the website to make it feel as though you are in Hogwarts. The board looks as though it is made of wood, the opening modal button that says "get sorted into your house" takes you immediately to The Great Hall where you are given information about the four houses and the concept of how you win and lose points.

2. RugbyTour

The RugbyTour application allows users to collect a list of all rugby tournaments within the states and abroad with each tournaments' location, date, and whether or not it is competitive or social event.

3. Relax and Learn
https://guitawesome.herokuapp.com/
App that is dedicated to helping beginning musicians learn how to play by sharing chords and tabs along with youtube videos to play along to. This is actually the exact way I learned how to play guitar. Looking up the chords and tabs and then listening along on youtube.

4. Roster
https://heroku-roster.herokuapp.com/
Roster is an app dedicated to all sports team that want to have an interactive way to see all teammates and players' info. Most teams including mine, use an excel sheet to keep tabs and that leads to a lot of unneeded data. Roster is a way to optimize that info and be able to quickly find what you are looking for.

5. Road to the Opry
https://roadtotheopry.herokuapp.com/
If you are a musician aspiring to be anyone, you want to be in the six foot circle of wood at the Grand Ole Opry. To get there, some think that the Nashville strip is the place to be...but the places where the songwriters go are just beyond the borders. This app shows you all of the venues where the great songwriters of Nashville go to play.
